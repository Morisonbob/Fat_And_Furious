# Fat_And_Furious
A 2D action game made with Unity.

A <b>zombie apocalypse</b> just happened at an <b>anime convention</b> and made people turn into <b><i>fat zombies</b></i>.
  Use more than <b>10 different weapons</b> to blast through various <b>unique enemies</b> and an (unexpected) final boss.


<b>#Talking Design#</b>

The game is programmed in a way that <b>every enemy(including the boss), collectible and weapon type</b> can have its behavior changed in the <b>Unity inspector</b>, with just a number change and checkbox click, thus making it easier for a game designer/level designer to mix and tweak a level <b>without the need of touching the code.</b>

The game counts with 1 weapon with <b>10 different bullet types</b>, every bullet distincts itself from the others, ranging from area effects, more damage, faster shooting, slowing the enemies' movement speed, etc.

The enemies have a basic form and the kind of attacks they do have various effects, speeds, and damage.

The boss is a unique enemy that has its own set of skills.

The game has only one level, that being the tutorial, that shows pretty much everything the game can do.
