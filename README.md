# Fat_And_Furious
A 2D action game made with Unity.
A zombie apocalypse just happened at a anime convention and made people turn into fat zombies.
Use more than 10 different weapon to blast trough various unique enemies and a (unexpected) final boss.

#Talking Design#

The game is programmed in a way that every enemy(including the boss), collectible and weapon type can have it's behavior changed in the Unity inspector, with just a number change and checkbox click, thus making it easy for a game designer/level designer to mix and tweek a level without the need of touching the code.
